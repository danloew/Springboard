    "This notebook continues the work done in Part I and II, this time focusing on building classification models that help differentiate the five types of cannabis crime in New York City between 2006-2018: misdemeanor possession, violation possession, felony possession, misdemeanor sales, and felony sales. These models will sequentially classify each crime type from the other four crime types using binary classification. This notebook continues to explore the line between cannabis possession and sales crimes at a greater level of granularity, while aiming to discover the most salient coefficients of the classification models to uncover the features of the dataset with the strongest relationship to each of the five cannabis crime types."

These features are dropped in the next cell, which also creates a subsetted DataFrame for use in classifying felony possession crimes. 'CMPLNT_NUM' uniquely identifies each crime, so it is also dropped to avoid leakage (as described in the data cleaning notebook for the creation of the cannabis/non-cannabis DataFrame)."

The Random Forest algorithm with 100 estimators performs the best, but the 'upsampled_fp_15' LogisticRegression algorithm will still be used to call the coefficients for the feature set as RandomForest is incapable of doing so, and these coefficients will help highlight the most salient features that differentiate cannabis felony possession crimes from all other cannabis crimes.

    "\n",
    "The model's precision is 0.04 for the felony possession class (the 1 class), 0.99 for the other cannabis crime types class (the 0 class), and 0.98 on weighted average, showing that 4% of predicted felony possession crimes are actual felony possession crimes, 99% of predicted other cannabis crimes are actual other cannabis crimes, and 98% of crimes on weighted average are predicted correctly. \n",
    "\n",
    "The model's recall is 0.67 for the felony possession class (the 1 class), 0.74 for the other cannabis crime types class (0), and 0.74 on weighted average, showing that 67% of actual felony possession crimes are predicted as felony possession crimes, 74% of actual other cannabis crimes are predicted as other cannabis crimes, and that 74% of crimes on weighted average are predicted correctly.\n",

    "The model's F1 score, or harmonic mean of precision and recall, is 0.08 for the felony possession class, 0.85 for the other cannabis crimes class, and 0.83 on weighted average. This metric is more informative than precision or recall alone, and shows that only 8% of felony possession crimes and 85% of other cannabis crimes are being predicted correctly, for a weighted average of 83%.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ROC curves plotted above show that the best LogisticRegression model ('upsampled_fp_15') has an ROC AUC score of 78.4%, showing that it is a moderately skillful model in predicting felony possession crimes at a rate higher than random. The Precision Recall Curve has an AUC score of 11.1%. The very low Precision Recall AUC score shows that the model is not very skilled at differentiating true positives from false positives and false negatives for the felony possession class. However, as is shown above, it is more skillful at predicting the other cannabis crime types as a group. Therefore, this model's coefficients cannot very well show the features in the NYPD's dataset that have the strongest statistical relationship with cannabis felony possession crimes between 2006 and 2018. The model's coefficients will be looked at below, but should be considered as speculative and as an area for future research.\n",

It has a 0.19 precision score for the felony possession class, a 0.98 precision score for the other crime types class, and a weighted average precision score of 0.97. The model has a recall score of 0.04 for the felony possession class, a 1.0 recall score for the other crime types class, and a weighted average recall score of 0.98. It has a 0.07 F1 score for the felony possession class, a 0.99 F1 score for the other crime types class, and a weighted average F1 score of 0.97. The ROC curve plotted above shows that it has an AUC score of 73.9%. This is a very unskillful model at predicting felony possession crimes. "

    "As detailed above, the F1 score for the felony possession class is only 0.08 when using the best performing Logistic Regression algorithm 'upsampled_fp_15'. However, the coefficients can still be valuable in identifying salient features of felony possession crimes to a certain degree if the F1 score is higher than zero. The only scenario where the coefficients would definitely not be valuable is if the algorithm only or almost only predicts one class. To check on whether the algorithm predicts both classes, and not just one, the predicted values 'upsampled_fp_pred_15' are converted to a Pandas Series and then its value counts are called. As can be seen, the felony possession class is predicted 11,899 times and the other cannabis crime types as a group are predicted 32,162 times. Therefore, the coefficients for the felony possession class are valuable and are called and analyzed below."

    "Because there are so many binarized features in the feature set, the interpretability of these features' coefficients and increased odds towards felony possession is better enabled by grouping the features into \"feature families\" (e.g. suspect race, borough, housing development). This grouping strategy involves taking the absolute value sum of all coefficients in the feature set, then summing the absolute values of the coefficients for each \"feature family\", and then dividing the absolute value coefficient sum of each \"feature family\" by the total absolute value coefficient sum to uncover the proportion of the total predictive value that each \"feature family\" has. This will help elucidate the \"feature families\" that have the strongest predictive power on whether a crime is a felony possession crime or another type of cannabis crime, and therefore which feature families should be explored further as having the strongest relationship to felony possession."

Any family with more than 10 percent of the total coefficient sum will be examined further. That includes housing developments, premises types, police precincts, and transit stations. Because suspect race is a main concern of arrest biases when it comes to cannabis crime, it is also examined."

    "The suspect race categories that have a relationship with felony possession crime are unexpected, given the fact that the majority of cannabis crimes where the suspect's race was reported are of African-Americans and Latinos. The suspect race category that has the strongest relationship with felony possession cries are Asians and Pacific Islanders, with a coefficient of 0.7 and an increased likelihood of 2%. American Indians/Alaskan Natives have a weak positive relationship with felony possession, as do the felony possession crimes with no suspect race reported. Meanwhile, white Hispanics have a totally neutral relationship, whites have a very weak negative relationship, black Hispanics have a weakly negative relationship, and African-Americans have a moderate negative relationship with felony cannabis possession crimes. This shows that in the context of cannabis possession, African-Americans have some kind of relationship with violation possession charges, but not really misdemeanor or felony possession charges."

Suspect race is associated with roughly a 1.1% odds increase in a cannabis crime being classified as a felony possession crime."
