    "This notebook continues the work done in Part I and II, this time focusing on building classification models that help differentiate the five types of cannabis crime in New York City between 2006-2018: misdemeanor possession, violation possession, felony possession, misdemeanor sales, and felony sales. These models will sequentially classify each crime type from the other four crime types using binary classification. This notebook continues to explore the line between cannabis possession and sales crimes at a greater level of granularity, while aiming to discover the most salient coefficients of the classification models to uncover the features of the dataset with the strongest relationship to each of the five cannabis crime types."

These features are dropped in the next cell, which also creates a subsetted DataFrame for use in classifying felony sales crimes. 'CMPLNT_NUM' uniquely identifies each crime, so it is also dropped to avoid leakage (as described in the data cleaning notebook for the creation of the cannabis/non-cannabis DataFrame)."

The Random Forest algorithm with 100 estimators performs the best, but the 'upsampled_mp_1' LogisticRegression algorithm will still be used to call the coefficients for the feature set as RandomForest is incapable of doing so, and these coefficients will help highlight the most salient features that differentiate cannabis felony sales crimes from all other cannabis crimes.

    "The ROC curves plotted above show that the best LogisticRegression model ('upsampled_fs_10') has an ROC AUC score of 67.3%, showing that it is not a very skillful model in predicting felony sales crimes at a rate higher than random. The Precision Recall Curve has an AUC score of 1.5%. The extremely low Precision Recall AUC score shows that the model is not skilled at all at differentiating true positives from false positives and false negatives for the felony sales class. However, as is shown above, it is more skillful at predicting the other cannabis crime types as a group. Therefore, this model's coefficients cannot very well show the features in the NYPD's dataset that have the strongest statistical relationship with cannabis felony sales crimes between 2006 and 2018. The model's coefficients will be looked at below, but should be considered as highly speculative and only as an area for future research.\n",

The model has a recall score of 0.01 for the felony sales class, a 1.0 recall score for the other crime types class, and a weighted average recall score of 0.99.

    "As detailed above, the F1 score for the felony sales class is only 0.02 when using the best performing Logistic Regression algorithm 'upsampled_fs_10'. However, the coefficients can still be valuable in identifying salient features of felony sales crimes to a certain degree if the F1 score is higher than zero. The only scenario where the coefficients would definitely not be valuable is if the algorithm only or almost only predicts one class. To check on whether the algorithm predicts both classes, and not just one, the predicted values 'upsampled_fs_pred_10' are converted to a Pandas Series and then its value counts are called. As can be seen, the felony sales class is predicted 12,888 times and the other cannabis crime types as a group are predicted 31,173 times. Therefore, the coefficients for the felony sales class are valuable and are called and analyzed below."

    "The specific premises features with the highest coefficients show that felony sales arrests have the strongest relationship with telecommunication stores with an increased likelihood of 174% and clothing stores and boutiques with an increased likelihood of 116%. Chain stores, beauty and nail salons, dry cleaners and laundromats, and livery licensed taxis have an increased likelihood of 53.8%, 49.4%, 38.2%, 21% respectively. This really suggests that there are many people with legitimate businesses that are distributing cannabis on the side, as it is unlikely that people not associated with these businesses are coming in to the business and conducting felony level sales. Other premises where felony level cannabis sales are occurring are public schools, highways and parkways, open areas and lots, bars and night clubs, tunnels, fast food restaurants, unclassified stores, bus terminals, groceries and bodegas, residential houses, commercial buildings, others, streets, residential apartment houses, public parking lots and garages, and public buildings. The increased likelihood of a cannabis crime being a felony sales crime for these other features range from 3% to 20%.\n",

    "Because there are so many binarized features in the feature set, the interpretability of these features' coefficients and increased odds towards felony sales is better enabled by grouping the features into \"feature families\" (e.g. suspect race, borough, housing development). This grouping strategy involves taking the absolute value sum of all coefficients in the feature set, then summing the absolute values of the coefficients for each \"feature family\", and then dividing the absolute value coefficient sum of each \"feature family\" by the total absolute value coefficient sum to uncover the proportion of the total predictive value that each \"feature family\" has. This will help elucidate the \"feature families\" that have the strongest predictive power on whether a crime is a felony sales crime or another type of cannabis crime, and therefore which feature families should be explored further as having the strongest relationship to felony sales."

Other premises where felony level cannabis sales are occurring are public schools, highways and parkways, open areas and lots, bars and night clubs, tunnels, fast food restaurants, unclassified stores, bus terminals, groceries and bodegas, residential houses, commercial buildings, others, streets, residential apartment houses, public parking lots and garages, and public buildings.
