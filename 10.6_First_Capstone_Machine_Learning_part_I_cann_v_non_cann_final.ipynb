    "This notebook uses the cleaned DataFrames built off of the \"NYPD Complaint Data Historic\" dataset (https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Complaint-Data-Historic/qgea-i56i) to build a series of classification models designed to identify the most salient predictors of cannabis arrests during the period of 2006-2018 by looking at the coefficients of the best performing Logistic Regression classifier. The cleaned DataFrames contain a series of features native to the NYPD's dataset, but also contain a series of derived features (as detailed in the Data Cleaning notebooks).\n",
    "\n",
    "The three different classification models are:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- A model classifying cannabis crimes from all other crimes in New York City (the focus of this notebook)\n",
    "- A model classifying cannabis possession crimes and cannabis sales crimes\n",
    "- A model classifying the five types of cannabis crime in New York City, namely misdemeanor possession, violation possession, felony possession, misdemeanor sales, and felony sales\n",
    "\n",
    "The first model will identify the strongest predictors of cannabis arrests in contrast to all other crimes; this model uses the cleaned universe of 220,304 NYC cannabis crimes committed between 2006 and 2018 combined with a random sample of 220,304 non-cannabis crimes committed during the same time period. The second model will classify on the more general categories of possession and sales, identifying the strongest predictors of each of these more general crime categories, and will only use the cleaned universe of cannabis crimes. The third model will identify the strongest predictors that differentiate each of the five types of cannabis crimes listed above, and will also only use the cleaned universe of cannabis crimes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The target features of the models are categorical and not continuous, so classification is the focus in this report. Because of the large sample size and feature size, the two classifier types that will be investigated are Logistic Regression and Random Forest."

The accuracy of the predictions will then be computed, and the models will be evaluated by calling its precision, recall, and F1 score, as well as by calling the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve and its Area Under the Curve (AUC) score.

    "The ROC curves and AUCs for the Random Forest classifier with 100 estimators and the best Logistic Regression classifier ('lr_21') are called to further evaluate these models.\n",
    "\n",
    "ROC curves help to compare models that predict probabilities for two-class problems. They use the predicted probabilities of each crime as being a cannabis crime (the 1 class) or a non-cannabis crime (the 0 class), while calibrating the threshold of how to interpret these predicted probabilities as belonging to the 1 class or the 0 class, while also reducing false positive or false negative errors in prediction. \n",
    "\n",
    "As shown below, ROC curves plot the false positive rate on the X-axis and the true positive rate on the Y-axis for a series of candidate threshold values between 0 and 1, so small values on the X-axis indicate lower false positives and higher true negatives, while larger values on the y-axis indicate higher true positives and lower false negatives. In this case, the area under the curve (AUC) summarizes the skill of the model in predicting cannabis crimes or non-cannabis crimes. A skillful model assigns a higher probability to a randomly chosen real positive occurrence than a negative occurrence on average. This explanation of ROC curves and their AUC is provided for clarification purposes, and is a distillation of Dr. Jason Brownlee's article on the subject at https://machinelearningmastery.com/roc-curves-and-precision-recall-curves-for-classification-in-python/.

The ROC curve plotted above shows that it has an AUC score of 92.4%. Therefore, this is a very skillful model and one that it is slightly more skillful than the best LogisticRegression model detailed above. It can be used to predict future crimes as being cannabis related or not, but because of its non-linear nature cannot uncover the features in the NYPD's dataset that have the strongest relationship with cannabis crimes.

    "Although causality for cannabis arrests cannot be attributed to them, the best Logistic Regression model's coefficients can show us which features have a strong relationship with cannabis crimes. Although there are surely a host of interactions between individual features within the feature set, for the sake of exploring which features have the strongest relationship with cannabis crime, it is assumed that they are independent of each other. With the assumption that we treat the Logistic Regression model as having no interaction terms, what the coefficients for binary features can illuminate is that if a binary feature has a value of 1, there is a certain increased likelihood that a crime will be a cannabis crime, highlighting its relationship to cannabis crime itself. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if a crime was committed on a park or playground (as denoted by the feature 'PREM_TYP_DESC_PARK/PLAYGROUND'), there is a 2.750705 unit increase in the log odds of it being a cannabis crime. When log odds are converted to odds, this 2.750705 unit increase is exponentiated to reveal a 15.65% increase in the odds of it being a cannabis crime (as discussed in the highly informative UCLA FAQ on interpeting odds ratios in Logistic Regression, available at https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/other/mult-pkg/faq/general/faq-how-do-i-interpret-odds-ratios-in-logistic-regression/). This 15.65% odds increase shows that cannabis crimes often occur in parks and playgrounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "For continuous features like the hour the crime complaint was made or its L1 latitude/longitude distance to the Williamsburg bridge, for each real number increase there is an increase in the odds that a crime is a cannabis crime. UPDATE\n",
    "\n",
    "To look at which features have the strongest relationship to cannabis crime, the features that have at least a 0.699809 coefficient are called and speculated on below by assigning the object 'cannabis_coeffs'. When exponentiated by assigning the object 'cannabis_coeffs_lls' ('ll' for \"likelihoods\"), these features are shown to provide at least a 2% increase in the odds of a crime being a cannabis crime.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach will be carried out in the other two machine learning notebooks that explore the relationships of the feature set with cannabis possession crimes as differentiated from cannabis sales crimes, as well as for the five types of cannabis crime (e.g., misdemeanor possession, violation possession, felony possession, misdemeanor sales, and felony sales)."

    "The hour and minute of the crime has a positive relationship with cannabis crime, with an increased odds of a crime being a cannabis crime of 7.9% and 2.7% respectively. This relationship seems to reflect the fact that cannabis arrests happen more often during the latter part of the day, as is shown below in the value counts for 'start_hour'. So that as the hour increases towards the 23rd hour, there are more cannabis arrests (as was shown in the Data Story and EDA notebook). The relationship of the minute of the crime somewhat shows that there are more cannabis arrests made during the latter part of the hour than in the earlier part of the hour, although the value counts called below for the 'start_minute' feature don't show an obvious pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "Transit District 23 is in Rockaway Park, Queens, and it has a 2.2% increased odds for cannabis crime. Its hard to say what relationship exists between this transit district and cannabis crime, but it does reflect the positive relationship between the 100th NYPD precinct noted above, which includes Rockaway Park. Because the majority of cannabis crimes were not transit related (approximately 98% had missing values for 'TRANSIT_DISTRICT' and 'STATION_NAME'), this particular Transit District in Rockaway Park, Queens must have had a concentrated effort or pattern of cannabis arrests on behalf of the NYPD and transit police. This may suggest a cannabis distribution hub of some kind.\n",
    "\n",
    "The relationship between cases with unknown suspect sex ('SUSP_SEX_cleaned_unknown') and cannabis crime is strong, with a coefficient of 2.5 and an increased odds of 12.2%. As is called below, the majority of cannabis arrests did not have the suspect's sex reported, suggesting that there is some confounding variable or reason for the NYPD not recording the suspect's sex for cannabis crimes much more than for non-cannabis crimes. As was explored in the Data Story and EDA notebook, as well as in the Statistical Data Analysis notebook, about 16% of cannabis crimes had the suspect's race, sex, and age recorded by the arresting officer, while about 38% of non-cannabis crimes had these demographic data recorded. Therefore, there is some reason for this disparity, which warrants future research as the cause for this missing demographic data cannot be determined through the current analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The feature storing whether the date of the crime complaint and the reported date of the crime match ('rpt_cmplnt_dt_match') also has a strong coefficient of 2.4 and an increased odds of 11.3%. The complaint date and the reported date of the crime matches for about 93% of cases (as shown below in the value counts for the 'rpt_cmplnt_dt_match' feature), showing that there is a confounding variable or reason for the high rate of matching for cannabis crimes more so than for non-cannabis crimes. This may simply be because NYPD officers were more likely to report cannabis crimes on the same day of the arrest. The majority of cannabis arrests are misdemeanor arrests, where NYPD officers bring the arrestees to central booking and report the crime. Although again, the true reason for this relationship would have to be explored through future research."

    "Because there are so many binarized features in the feature set, the interpretability of these features' coefficients and increased odds towards cannabis crime is better enabled by grouping the features into \"feature families\" (e.g. suspect race, borough, housing development). This grouping strategy involves taking the absolute value sum of all coefficients in the feature set, then summing the absolute values of the coefficients for each \"feature family\", and then dividing the absolute value coefficient sum of each \"feature family\" by the total absolute value coefficient sum to uncover the proportion of the total predictive value that each \"feature family\" has. This will help elucidate the \"feature families\" that have the strongest predictive power on whether a crime is a cannabis or non-cannabis crime, and therefore which feature families should be explored further as having the strongest relationship to cannabis crime."

The increased odds that a crime is a cannabis crime for people aged less than 18 years is 2.5%, for people aged 18-24 is 4.2%, and for people aged 25-44 is 2%. This data adds more credence to an age bias in cannabis arrests. \n",

This disparity in statistical relationships may be due to older people being more careful with their cannabis use and therefore may be less likely to be caught, or it could be that younger people are being targeted by the police for cannabis crimes. Obviously, the cause for these statistical relationships cannot be uncovered by this project, but this is definitely an area for future research."

These coefficients simply show that there is a stronger (but still weak) relationship with non-cannabis crime than for cannabis crime, which makes sense as cannabis crime is only a subset of all crimes.\n",

This finding is confusing given the racial skew in cannabis arrests. It is important to again underline that the NYPD's data on suspect race for cannabis crimes is very partial with only 16% of crimes having their suspect's race reported. It is clear from the hypothesis testing done in the Statistical and Data Analysis notebook that the racial disparity in cannabis arrests is not due to chance and that there is a confounding reason for the disparity, but the web of confounding variables associated with this disparity needs to be explored further.\n",

This step is taken to show the proportion that each racial group has of the relationship between suspect race and whether a crime is a cannabis crime or non-cannabis crime.\n",

    "The following series of cells subsets DataFrames for crimes committed by each of the racial/ethnic groups, where the suspect's race was actually recorded. The value counts for the 'cannabis_crime' target feature is called, showing the counts and percentage of criminals of each racial group that were arrested for cannabis that had their race reported by the arresting officer. Values of 1 indicate that the crimes committed by that racial/ethnic group were for cannabis.\n",

    "It is important to note that the DataFrame that the Logistic Regression model was trained on was composed of all of the cannabis crimes between 2006 and 2018 and a representative sample of all other crimes of the same size as the cannabis crimes. Therefore, the percentages reported below are of this concatenated DataFrame of all cannabis crimes and a representative sample of all other cannabis crimes. Therefore, higher percentages can be interpreted as a bias in cannabis arrests for that racial/ethnic group.\n",
    "\n",
    "This shows that for the DataFrame used, 30% of African-American criminals, 33% of White Hispanic criminals, 18% of White criminals, 40% of Black Hispanic criminals, 20% of Native American criminals and 19% of Asians or Pacific Islanders in New York City between 2006 and 2018 were arrested for cannabis. We see again that White criminals have the lowest arrest rate for cannabis, roughly equivalent with that of Native American and Asian/Pacific Islander criminals. African-American and Hispanic criminals are shown to be arrested at a higher percentage than the other racial/ethnic groups. This is another way to highlight the racial disparity in arrests, and helps to make better sense of the coefficients for the racial categories that were returned by the Logistic Regression model. "
