    "This notebook continues the work done in Part I and II, this time focusing on building classification models that help differentiate the five types of cannabis crime in New York City between 2006-2018: misdemeanor possession, violation possession, felony possession, misdemeanor sales, and felony sales. These models will sequentially classify each crime type from the other four crime types using binary classification. This notebook continues to explore the line between cannabis possession and sales crimes at a greater level of granularity, while aiming to discover the most salient coefficients of the classification models to uncover the features of the dataset with the strongest relationship to each of the five cannabis crime types."

These features are dropped in the next cell, which also creates a subsetted DataFrame for use in classifying misdemeanor possession crimes. 'CMPLNT_NUM' uniquely identifies each crime, so it is also dropped to avoid leakage (as described in the data cleaning notebooks for the creation of the cannabis/non-cannabis DataFrame)."

The Random Forest algorithm with 100 estimators performs the best, but the 'upsampled_mp_1' LogisticRegression algorithm will still be used to call the coefficients for the feature set as RandomForest is incapable of doing so, and these coefficients will help highlight the most salient features that differentiate cannabis misdemeanor possession crimes from all other cannabis crimes.

As Dr. Brownlee says, the future performance of a model with imbalanced class counts is better evaluated with a Precision-Recall Curve than an ROC curve. Specific modules are first imported for use in calculating the Precision-Recall Curve."

    "\n",
    "The model's precision is 0.94 for the misdemeanor possession class (the 1 class), 0.20 for the other cannabis crime types class (the 0 class), and 0.86 on weighted average, showing that 94% of predicted misdemeanor  possession crimes are actual misdemeanor possession crimes, 20% of predicted other cannabis crimes are actual other cannabis crimes, and 86% of cannabis crimes on average are predicted correctly. \n",
    "\n",
    "The model's recall is 0.73 for the misdemeanor possession class (the 1 class), 0.58 for the other cannabis crime types class (0), and 0.72 on weighted average, showing that 73% of actual misdemeanor possession crimes are predicted as misdemeanor possession crimes, 58% of actual other cannabis crimes are predicted as other cannabis crimes, and that 72% of cannabis crimes on average are predicted correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model's F1 score, or harmonic mean of precision and recall, is 0.82 for the misdemeanor possession class, 0.30 for the other cannabis crimes class, and 0.77 on weighted average. This metric is more informative than precision or recall alone, and shows that 82% of misdemeanor possession crimes and 30% of other cannabis crimes are being predicted correctly, for a weighted average of 77%.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ROC curves plotted above show that the best LogisticRegression model ('upsampled_mp_1') has an ROC AUC score of 71.9%, showing that it is a moderately skillful model in predicting misdemeanor possession crimes at a rate higher than random. The Precision Recall Curve has an AUC score of 94.8%. The higher Precision Recall AUC score shows that the model is skilled at differentiating true positives from false positives and false negatives, especially for the cannabis misdemeanor possession class. However, as is shown above, it is not as skillful at predicting the other cannabis crime types as a group. Therefore, this model's coefficients can show the features in the NYPD's dataset that have the strongest statistical relationship with cannabis misdemeanor possession crimes between 2006 and 2018, but the coefficients for the other cannabis crimes types as a whole should be considered as speculative to a certain degree, which is acceptable as the other crime types will be classified individually below.\n",

    "The RandomForest model with 100 estimators has an accuracy of 0.88034769977985. It has a 0.92 precision score for the misdemeanor possession class, a 0.39 precision score for the other crime types class, and a weighted average precision score of 0.86. The model has a recall score of 0.95 for the misdemeanor possession class, a 0.26 recall score for the other crime types class, and a weighted average recall score of 0.88. It has a 0.93 F1 score for the misdemeanor possession class, a 0.31 F1 score for the other crime types class, and a weighted average F1 score of 0.87. The ROC curve plotted above shows that it has an AUC score of 71.8%. This is a skillful model at predicting misdemeanor possession crimes, but because of its non-linear nature cannot uncover the features in the NYPD's dataset that have the strongest relationship with misdemeanor possession crimes.

These features have increased likelihoods of cannabis crimes being misdemeanor possession crimes between 6.7% and 2.3%, with marinas and piers having the highest likelihoods and social clubs having the least. Some of these features reflect how cannabis users must utilize open public spaces to smoke and be caught by the police. Notably, the high rates of cannabis arrests in public housing buildings is again shown with the \"PREM_TYP_DESC_RESIDENCE - PUBLIC HOUSING\" feature's coefficient of 0.9 and increased likelihood of a misdemeanor possession charge of 2.9%. Also, the definition of the feature \"PREM_TYP_DESC_SOCIAL CLUB/POLICY\" is unclear, but it seems misdemeanor possession charges are occurring in social clubs in New York City. Whether these are private clubs being raided or normal public bars and music clubs is unclear.\n",

Williamsburg and the Lower East Side are two neighborhoods on either side of the Williamsburg Bridge, both of which are known as countercultural or \"hipster\" neighborhoods, which may explain the relationship.

    "Because there are so many binarized features in the feature set, the interpretability of these features' coefficients and increased odds towards misdemeanor possession is better enabled by grouping the features into \"feature families\" (e.g. suspect race, borough, housing development). This grouping strategy involves taking the absolute value sum of all coefficients in the feature set, then summing the absolute values of the coefficients for each \"feature family\", and then dividing the absolute value coefficient sum of each \"feature family\" by the total absolute value coefficient sum to uncover the proportion of the total predictive value that each \"feature family\" has. This will help elucidate the \"feature families\" that have the strongest predictive power on whether a crime is a misdemeanor possession crime or another type of cannabis crime, and therefore which feature families should be explored further as having the strongest relationship to misdemeanor possession."

Notably, the high rates of cannabis arrests in public housing buildings is again shown with the \"PREM_TYP_DESC_RESIDENCE - PUBLIC HOUSING\" feature's coefficient of 0.9 and increased likelihood of a misdemeanor possession charge of 2.9%. Also, the definition of the feature \"PREM_TYP_DESC_SOCIAL CLUB/POLICY\" is unclear, but it seems misdemeanor possession charges are occurring in social clubs in New York City.
